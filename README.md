CLI program for generating wavetables. A wavetable is a set of single-cycle
waveforms which can be played back by audio software. The software can vary the
sound generated by changing which waveform it is playing back at any one time.

Waveform shapes can be specified either using the built-in values 'saw', 'sine',
'square' and triangle, or can be specified using a Lua expression.

By default, each waveform has a length of 2048 samples and 256 waveforms are
generated. This is the default size used by the Polyend Tracker.

Examples
--------

Create a waveform that morphs between a sine wave and a square wave:

```
tabler --start=sine --end=square sine_square.wav
```

Create a waveform that morphs between a sine wave and another sine wave with
three times the frequency:

```
tabler --start=sine --end="math.sine(3 * x)" sine_3sine.wav
```

Create a waveform with custom wave length and number of waveforms:

```
tabler --start=triangle --end=square --samples=1024 --waves=128 tri_square.wav
```
